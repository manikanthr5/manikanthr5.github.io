They\u2019re just along for the ride when it\u2019s fun or convenient. Your real friends are there for you when you have nothing to offer.</li> <li>You'll only see your loved ones a few more times. Remember: It's later than you think.</li> <li>You'll literally never know what you want to be when you grow up (and that's perfectly fine!).</li> <li>Most people don't really care about you. The Spotlight Effect says that we overestimate the degree to which other people are observing our actions. This should be liberating.</li> <li>You don't need to have an opinion on everything. It's perfectly reasonable to have no opinion on something that you haven't researched or don't understand.</li> <li>You probably won't be remembered or have a legacy. In a few thousand years, chances are we will all be forgotten.</li> <li>You can tell everything you need to know about a person by observing:</li> <li>how they treat service workers and</li> <li>whether they put their shopping cart back.</li> <li>You can get pretty damn far in life by just saying what you're going to do and then doing it. No fancy hack needed.</li> <li>Most of us need fewer friends and more intellectual sparring partners. Friends are easy to come by, but intellectual sparring partners question our assumptions and force us to level up.</li> <li>Being kind to people is the only real life hack. Kindness remains severely underrated.</li> <li>We should all stop talking about how many books we read last year. It's much more impressive to read one book and have it deeply impact you than to read 100 books and not feel a thing.</li> <li>You should never bet against a person who just keeps showing up.</li> <li>Most of the people you look up to and admire are remarkably unremarkable. Their success is not due to some intrinsic difference, but some stellar combination of effort and luck.</li> <li>If it seems too good to be true, it probably is (and you should run away).</li> <li>You're probably being held back by your unwillingness to ask. Remember: Closed mouths don't get fed.</li> <li>Failure doesn't always lead to growth. Sometimes failure just leads to pain. Sometimes the growth doesn't come from the failure, but from simply outlasting the darkness.</li> <li>Waking up early is the easiest way to improve your odds of success. You don't have to wake up early to be successful, but you rarely find an early riser that isn't winning.</li> <li>Hard work is not overrated. That's ridiculous. 99% of successful people worked very hard.</li> <li>Showing up early costs very little and pays off handsomely in the long run.</li> <li>The world is not fair. Bad people win and good people lose\u2014all the time. The world may never be truly fair, but it will always belong to those who make the most of what they have before them.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"about/visit-100-countries/","title":"Visit 100 Countries","text":"<p>In this page, I will track the list of 100 countries (aside from India), that I got to visit/want to visit. </p> <p>TODO: Update the blog with a world map which shows Indian territorial integrity properly. </p> <ol> <li>\u2713 Nepal</li> <li>\u2717 Japan</li> <li>\u2717 Bhutan</li> <li>\u2717 Sri Lanka</li> <li>\u2717 Vietnam</li> <li>\u2717 Bangladesh</li> <li>\u2717 United States of America</li> <li>\u2717 United Arab Emirates</li> <li>\u2717 Singapore</li> <li>\u2717 </li> <li>\u2717 </li> <li>\u2717 </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/placement-preparation-for-btech-students/","title":"Placement Preparation for B.Tech Students","text":"<p>I have been asked from some of my friends on how to prepare for their upcoming campus selections.
