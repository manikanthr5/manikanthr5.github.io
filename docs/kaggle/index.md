# Kaggle

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a platform for users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

## Competitions
This is a list of competitions I have participated in:

- [Feedback Prize - English Language Learning](#feedback-prize---english-language-learning) - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-english-language-learning) 
- [Riiid Answer Correctness Prediction](#riiid-answer-correctness-prediction) - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/riiid-test-answer-prediction) 
- [Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction](#mechanisms-of-action-moa-prediction) - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lish-moa) 

## Feedback Prize - English Language Learning

The goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better supports all students.


## Riiid Answer Correctness Prediction

In this competition, we have to create algorithms for "Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. We will pair our machine learning skills using Riiid’s EdNet data.

## Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction

In this competition, we have access to a unique dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. The data is based on a new technology that measures simultaneously (within the same samples) human cells’ responses to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types (thus solving the problem of identifying ex-ante, which cell types are better suited for a given drug). In addition, we will have access to MoA annotations for more than 5,000 drugs in this dataset.
